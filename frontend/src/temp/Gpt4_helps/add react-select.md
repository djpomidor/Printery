In your example, you're using a standard HTML select element, which doesn't support user input out of the box. What you're looking for seems to be a "combo box" or "autocomplete" field (a dropdown field that also accepts input).

The good news is, there are many libraries that provide this kind of functionality. A widely adopted one is React Select. React Select is not automatically compatible with Formik, but it can be adapted pretty easily.

Here's how you can implement what you're looking for. First, you need to install react-select:

```
npm install react-select
```
or
```
yarn add react-select
```

Then, you can define a Formik-compatible component that wraps ReactSelect:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import Select from 'react-select';

const SelectField = ({ options, field, form }) => {
  const handleChange = (value) => {
    form.setFieldValue(field.name, value.value);
  };

  const handleBlur = () => {
    form.setFieldTouched(field.name, true);
  };

  return (
    <Select
      options={options}
      name={field.name}
      value={options ? options.find(option => option.value === field.value) : ''}
      onChange={handleChange}
      onBlur={handleBlur}
    />
  );
};
```

In the `SelectField` component, we're mapping the change and blur event handlers to Formik's `setFieldValue` and `setFieldTouched` respectively.

Then, you can use this SelectField in your Formik forms:

```jsx
const colorOptions = [
  { value: '', label: 'Select...' },
  { value: '4_4', label: '4(CMYK)+4(CMYK)' },
  { value: '4_0', label: '4(CMYK)+0' },
  { value: '1_1', label: '1(Black)+1(Black)' },
];

// Then, in your Formik form
<Field
  component={SelectField}
  options={colorOptions}
  name={`parts.${index}.color`}
/>
```

This way, you're mapping the label and value of each option for the Select component using `colorOptions`.

I hope this helps. Let me know if you have more questions!
